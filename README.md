# Logion API

This project provides different packages which may be used by developers to interact with the logion network.

The complete documentation is available [here](https://logion-network.github.io/logion-api/).

The [client package](packages/client/README.md) is used to connect a typescript/javascript application to the logion-network.

The [extension package](packages/extension/README.md) is used to use [Polkadot JS extension](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension#readme) together with the client to sign operations on the logion-network.
